- [x] Bid model (bid.py)

### Database Setup
- [x] Ensure database connections are properly configured (app/database.py)
- [x] Run initial migrations to create necessary tables

### API Documentation
- [x] Set up basic Swagger/OpenAPI documentation for implemented endpoints

## General

### Environment Setup
- [x] Ensure all necessary environment variables are defined in .env file
- [x] Update requirements.txt with all necessary dependencies

### Testing
- [ ] Implement basic unit tests for critical backend functions
- [ ] Add integration tests for key API endpoints

### Deployment
- [ ] Set up a basic deployment pipeline for both frontend and backend
- [ ] Deploy MVP to a staging environment for testing

## Integration Tasks

- [ ] Fully integrate vendor portal with backend (replace mock data)
- [ ] Fully integrate admin portal with backend (replace mock data)
- [ ] Link farmer, vendor, and admin processes for a cohesive user experience
- [ ] Implement real-time data updates for bidding and listings
- [ ] Add functionality for admins to manage users and listings
- [ ] Implement a notification system for bid updates and listing changes

## Notes

- The vendor and admin portals are currently created with mock data and need to be fully integrated with the backend.
- The farmer, vendor, and admin processes should be linked to create a seamless experience across all user types.
- Real-time updates for bidding and listings should be implemented to enhance user experience.
- Additional features like logistics tracking, payment integration, and advanced filtering can be considered for future phases.
